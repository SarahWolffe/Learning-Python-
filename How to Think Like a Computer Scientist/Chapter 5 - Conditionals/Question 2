Exercises: You go on a wonderful holiday (perhaps to jail, if you donâ€™t like happy exercises) leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday).
You return home after 137 sleeps. Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number,
and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the name of day of the week you will return on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: 

start_day = int(input('What is the starting day number of your holiday? '))
length = int(input('What is the length of your stay? '))
number = (length + start_day) % 7

def weekdays(number):
    if number == 0:
        return 'Monday'
    elif number == 1:
        return 'Tuesday'
    elif number == 2:
        return 'Wednesday'
    elif number == 3:
        return 'Thursday'
    elif number == 4:
        return 'Friday'
    elif number == 5:
        return 'Saturday'
    else:
        number == 6
        return 'Sunday'


print('Your return day is ' + str(weekdays(number)))
