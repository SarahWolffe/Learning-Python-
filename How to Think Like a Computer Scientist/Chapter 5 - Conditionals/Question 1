Exercises: Assume the days of the week are numbered 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 from Sunday to Saturday.
Write a function which is given the day number, and it returns the day name (a string).

def weekdays(number):
    if number == 0:
        print('Monday')
    elif number == 1:
        print('Tuesday')
    elif number == 2:
        print('Wednesday')
    elif number == 3:
        print('Thursday')
    elif number == 4:
        print('Friday')
    elif number == 5:
        print('Saturday')
    else:
        number == 6
        print('Sunday')
