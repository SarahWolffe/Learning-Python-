# Learning-Python-

My answers to programming practice exercises, set by different 'Python for Beginners' resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At present, this directory contains two folders for two different OER online Python-learning resources. They contain my answers to the exercises (questions and practice projects) set by the authors at the end of their chapters, which require the reader to write programs. 

The resource names, authors and links with chapter/exercise guides are outlined below:

These resources do not provide their own answers for the programming exercises, and there are many ways to address the same exercise. I hope that others benefit from taking a look at how I addressed the exercises. The folders here are a work in progress. As I make my way through more chapters, I hope to keep updating their contents. As I discover further useful learning resources with exercises, I will add folders which represent them and contain my answers.
