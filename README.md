# Learning-Python-

My answers to programming practice exercises, set by different 'Python for Beginners' resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At present, this directory contains two folders for two different OER online Python-learning resources. They contain my answers to the programming exercises (questions and practice projects) set by these resources. 

The resource names and links with chapter/exercise guides are outlined below: 

* Name: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners
Link: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
  
* Name: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3

Link: https://www.ict.ru.ac.za/Resources/cspw/thinkcspy3/thinkcspy3_latest/index.html
  

These resources do not provide their own answers, and there are many ways to address the same exercise. I hope that others benefit from taking a look at how I addressed the exercises. The folders here are a work in progress. As I make my way through more chapters, I hope to keep updating their contents. As I discover further useful learning resources with exercises, I will add folders which represent them and contain my answers.
