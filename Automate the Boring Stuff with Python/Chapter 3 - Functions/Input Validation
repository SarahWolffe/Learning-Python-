Input Validation

Add try and except statements to the previous project (Colltaz Sequence) to detect whether the user types in a noninteger string. 
Normally, the int() function will raise a ValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy'). 
In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer.

def seq3np1(n):
    """ Print the 3n+1 sequence from n,
        terminating when it reaches 1.
    """
    while n != 1:             # provided n is not equal to 1, execute the loop body.
        print(n, end=", ")
        if n % 2 == 0:        # n is even
            n = n // 2
        else:                 # n is odd
            n = n * 3 + 1
    print(n, end=".\n")
